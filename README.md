Really Simple Cards
===================

RSS + Google Now cards.

By example, a live sports match has a summary card with the scores but is built up of a stream of data. An RSS feed is a stream of data. Sometimes a summary card doesn't make sense, sometimes it does. Roll up information that can be rolled up, when the person views it. Push summaries and new information to the person.

Topics down the left e.g. Tech, science, travel, sports, news, etc.
